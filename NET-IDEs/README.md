# .NET IDEs

A short slide deck that I have thrown together using reveal.js. See the [reveal-js readme](./reveal-js-readme.md) for details on that library.

It is meant as a slightly humorous way to look at the main IDEs and tools available for .NET developers.

## Requirements

The following pieces of software are required to build and run this slide deck:

- [node (4.0.0 or later)](http://nodejs.org/)
- yarn
  - because it's better than npm
- grunt


## Running The Presentation

Assuming that you have a terminal open in the root of the repo:

1. `npm install -g yarn`
1. `npm install -g grunt`
1. `yarn install`
1. `grunt serve`

A web browser should open, point at [localhost:5500](localhost:5500/), and the slide deck will be available to view.
