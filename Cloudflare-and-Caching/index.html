						### Caching

						![Raphael complaining about cricket](./images/cricket.gif)

						- That thing you need to clear when testing JavaScript changes
						- Covered it before [in a blog post](https://dev.to/dotnetcoreblog/speeding-up-your-website--part-one-terminology-4l60)

						### Routing on the Web

						![Traditional routing](./images/spared-no-expense-1.jpg)

						- [https://dotnetcore.show](https://dotnetcore.show/) is hosted in London
						- 40% of traffic comes from the US

							Page loads (for US IP addresses) _before_ I did anything were around a second

						### What's Wrong With That?

						|   |   |   |
						|---|---|---|
						| L1 cache reference  | 0.5 ns  |   |
						| Branch mispredict  | 5 ns |   |
						| L2 cache reference | 7 ns  | 14x L1 cache  |
						| Send 1K bytes over 1 Gbps network | 10,000 ns (10 us) | |
						| Round trip within same datacenter | 500,000 ns (500 us) | |
						| Read 1 MB sequentially from disk | 20,000,000 ns (20,000 us) | |
						| Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA | 150,000,000 ns (150,000 us or 150 ms) | |

						- [Latency numbers that every programmer should understand](https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832)

						<aside class="notes">
							These numbers are from 2012 <br/>
							Lots of numbers, but 1MB is about 90 seconds of speech in MP3 at 128Kbps <br/>
							L1 -> As quick as a it gets, how long it takes light to travel 6″ <br/>
							1MB sequentially -> 2 million x slower than L1 <br/>
							Packet -> 300 million times slower than L1 <br/>

						### But in Human terms

						|   |   |   |
						|---|---|---|
						| L1 cache reference  | 0.5 s | One heart beat (0.5 s) |
						| Branch mispredict  | 5 s | Yawn |
						| L2 cache reference | 7 s  | Long yawn  |
						| Send 1K bytes over 1 Gbps network | 5.5 hr | From lunch to end of work day |
						| Round trip within same datacenter | 5.8 days | |
						| Read 1 MB sequentially from disk | 11.6 days | |
						| Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA | 4.8 years | Average time it takes me to answer a question |

						### Page Load Process

						1.  Browser figures out where the server is (routing/DNS lookup)
						2.  Browser asks the server for the HTML
						3.  Server responds with the HTML
						4.  Browser looks through the HTML for images, CSS, JavaScript, videos, etc.
						5.  Browser asks the server for each of those files
						6.  Browser starts downloading this files 
						7.  While it's doing this, it starts to draw the web page for you
						8.  Files are added to the page as they come back from the server
					</textarea>

					<aside class="notes">
						Your browser can download files in parallel, but it's limited to around 5-10 at a time <br/>
					</aside>

				<section data-markdown>

						### Caching (redux)

						- Once everyting is loaded, some of it is cached
						- Next time you access the site, it can be loaded from the cache
						- Great for files which don't change often
						  - like images
						- Not so much for stuff that changes often
						  - like dev time JS
						- Also has a size limit
					</textarea>

					<aside class="notes">
						Your browser can download files in parallel, but it's limited to around 5-10 at a time <br/>
						Different sources list the cache limit at between 350 MB and "unlimited" <br/>
						Mobile users will be pretty upset if you break their phone because you've filled up their cache

						### What's Cloudflare Got To Do
						#### Got To Do With It?

						![Cloudflare example](./images/spared-no-expense-2.jpg)

						- [https://dotnetcore.show](https://dotnetcore.show/) is hosted in London
						- Cloudflare have a server farm in [Manchester](https://blog.cloudflare.com/manchester-uk-cloudflares-63rd-data-center/)
					</textarea>

					<aside class="notes">
						Page loads (for US IP addresses) dropped to 400-600ms <br/>
						That's complete page load and draw, btw <br/>
						I'm leveraging a _lot_ of client and server side caching, too
					</aside>

					<textarea data-template>
						### A CD What?

						![Cloudflare's Server Map](./images/cloudflare-server-map.jpg)

						- Correct as of Nov, 2018
						- Each blob is a server farm
						- Each server farm has a cached copy of the website
						- User get's the cached copy from the closest server farm
					</textarea>

					<aside class="notes">
						US visitors get the latest cached version from a US server farm near them <br/>
						As do folks in Japan, or Kuwait, or wherever <br/>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### How Does It Work?

						![Cloudflare Process in a nutshell](./images/spared-no-expense-3.jpg)

						- Origin: the server that [https://dotnetcore.show/](https://dotnetcore.show/) is running on
					</textarea>

					<aside class="notes">
						When the very first request for a page or resource at the site is sent, Cloudflare passes it to the origin <br/>
						In this instance, Origin in the actual server which is running the site <br/>
						On the return journey, the response is cached in Cloudflare's CDN <br/>
						This is then propagated throughout Cloudflare's network in a matter of seconds <br/>
						Any subsiquent request for the same resource is served by Cloudflare <br />
						This is until Cloudflare detects a change at origin <br/>
						This can be forced by the site admin (in the cloudflare panel) <br/>
